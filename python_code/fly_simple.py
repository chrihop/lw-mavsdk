    Returns a LocationGlobal object containing the latitude/longitude `dNorth` and `dEast` metres from the

    The function is useful when you want to move the vehicle around specifying locations relative to

    The algorithm is relatively accurate over small distances (10m within 1km) except close to the poles.
